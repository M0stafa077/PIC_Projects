## Real-Time Clock Project

Real-Time Clock Project with PIC microcontroller, the project is an implementation of some modules and drivers like (MCAL\TIMER0 driver, MCAL\TIMER1 driver, MCAL\Interrupts driver, ..) and seven segment display with Multiplexing technique.

## Layers

The project consists of three main layers as follow:

 - **App Layer :** The Application layer contains the project main files.
 - **MCAL Layer :** The Microcontroller Abstraction Layer contains all the 		                  
                    microcontroller peripherals drivers.
 - **ECUAL Layer :** The Electronic Unit Abstraction Layer contains the drivers of the electronic devices.
