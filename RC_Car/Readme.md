## RC Car Project

Radio-Controlled Car using PIC  Microcontroller, the project is for implementing the UART Communication Protocol
interfacing with HC - 05 Bluetooth Module

## Layers

The project consists of three main layers as follow:

 - **App Layer :** The Application layer contains the project main files.
 - **MCAL Layer :** The Microcontroller Abstraction Layer contains all the 		                  
                     microcontroller peripherals drivers.
 - **ECUAL Layer :** The Electronic Unit Abstraction Layer contains the drivers 
                     of the electronic devices.
