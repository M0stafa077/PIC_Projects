# Temperature Control Project

Temperature Control Project with PIC microcontroller, the project is an implementation of some modules and drivers like (MCAL\ADC driver, MCAL\Interrupts driver, ..) and some electronic devices and units like (ECUAL\LCD, ECUAL\Buzzer).

## Layers

The project consists of three main layers as follow:

 - **App Layer :** The Application layer contains the project main files.
 - **MCAL Layer :** The Microcontroller Abstraction Layer contains all the 		                  
                    microcontroller peripherals drivers.
 - **ECUAL Layer :** The Electronic Unit Abstraction Layer contains the drivers of the electronic devices.
